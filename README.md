# Geonames Search and Information Display

## Description

Welcome to the Geonames Search and Information Display project! This web application allows users to explore geographical data, access Wikipedia articles related to selected locations, and obtain real-time weather information from the nearest weather station. The project aims to provide a seamless experience for users to gain insights into various locations around the world.
